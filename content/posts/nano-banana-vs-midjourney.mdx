### Nano Banana Studio Strengths

## Image-to-Image Editing

Use the /blend command or --iw parameter to incorporate reference images. Requires learning the syntax.

### Nano Banana Studio
Simply upload an image and describe the changes you want. The AI understands natural language instructions like:
