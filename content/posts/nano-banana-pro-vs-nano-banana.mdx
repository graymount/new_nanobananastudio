## Nano Banana

### Strengths

**Speed Champion**
Nano Banana is optimized for high-volume, low-latency tasks. If you need quick iterations to explore ideas, this is your model.

**Cost Effective**
Same credit cost as Pro, but faster turnaround means you can experiment more in less time.

**Great for Drafts**
Perfect for initial concept exploration before committing to a final, high-resolution render.

### Limitations

- Maximum 1024px resolution
- Single image input for editing
- Basic text rendering (may have spelling issues)
- Standard reasoning without "thinking" mode

### Best Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping and idea exploration
- Social media content (Instagram, Twitter)
- Quick edits and style transfers
- Batch generation for selection

## Nano Banana Pro

### Strengths

**"Deep Think" Reasoning**
Pro uses advanced reasoning to understand complex prompts. It considers physics, composition, and your intent before generating—resulting in more coherent images.

**4K Resolution**
Generate images up to 4096px for professional print and commercial use.

**Multi-Image Merge**
Combine up to 14 reference images into one cohesive scene. This supports:
- Up to 6 objects for consistency
- Up to 5 humans for character consistency
- Complex scene composition

**Superior Text Rendering**
Pro excels at rendering legible, stylized typography—perfect for posters, logos, and infographics.

**Google Search Grounding**
Connect to real-time data for accurate charts, diagrams, and information visualization.

### Best Use Cases

- Professional marketing materials
- Print-quality artwork (posters, merchandise)
- Complex multi-element scenes
- Text-heavy designs (posters, infographics)
- Character sheets and brand consistency
- Commercial product photography

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Social Media Content Creator
**Recommendation: Nano Banana**

You're creating daily Instagram posts and need quick turnaround. Speed matters more than 4K resolution since social platforms compress images anyway.

### Scenario 2: Graphic Designer
**Recommendation: Nano Banana Pro**

You're designing a concert poster with the band name prominently displayed. Pro's text rendering ensures the typography is crisp and correctly spelled.

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Product Photos
**Recommendation: Nano Banana Pro**

You need to merge product photos with lifestyle backgrounds while maintaining brand consistency. Pro's multi-image capability handles this perfectly.

### Scenario 4: Game Concept Artist
**Recommendation: Both**

Use Nano Banana for rapid concept exploration (10-20 quick iterations), then switch to Pro for the final high-resolution renders of approved concepts.

### Scenario 5: Character Design
**Recommendation: Nano Banana Pro**

You need consistent character appearance across multiple poses and scenes. Pro's multi-image reference (up to 5 humans) maintains consistency.

## When to Use Each Model

### Choose Nano Banana When:
- You need results in seconds, not minutes
- You're exploring ideas and don't need final quality
- The output will be viewed on screens (not print)
- You want to iterate quickly through many variations

### Choose Nano Banana Pro When:
- You need print-quality resolution (4K)
- Your image contains text that must be readable
- You're combining multiple reference images
- The result is for professional/commercial use
- You need complex scene composition

## Pro Tips

### Hybrid Workflow
Many professionals use both models:
1. **Draft phase:** Nano Banana for 10-20 quick iterations
2. **Selection:** Pick the best 2-3 concepts
3. **Refinement:** Nano Banana Pro for final high-res renders

### Text in Images
If your image contains any text:
- **Nano Banana:** May produce spelling errors or unclear text
- **Nano Banana Pro:** Reliably renders text correctly

Always use Pro for text-heavy designs like posters, logos, or infographics.

### Resolution Planning
- **Web/Social:** Nano Banana's 1024px is sufficient
- **Print/Commercial:** Nano Banana Pro's 4K is essential
