Professional product photography used to mean renting a studio, hiring a photographer, and spending $500+ per session. In 2026, AI can generate product images that rival studio shots — in minutes, for pennies.

This guide shows you exactly how to create e-commerce-ready product photos using AI, with prompt templates you can copy and customize.

## What AI Product Photography Can Do

AI image generators can now create:

- **White background product shots** — clean, Amazon/Shopify-ready
- **Lifestyle scenes** — products placed in real-world settings
- **Seasonal variations** — holiday, summer, back-to-school themes
- **Multiple angles** — front, side, top-down views
- **Color variants** — show the same product in different colors
- **Scale/context shots** — product next to everyday objects for size reference

## When to Use AI vs. Real Photography

| Scenario | AI Photography | Real Photography |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| New product concept/mockup | ✅ Perfect | ❌ Overkill |
| Social media content | ✅ Great | ✅ Great |
| Amazon/Shopify listing | ⚠️ Good for supplementary images | ✅ Best for main image |
| Ad creative testing | ✅ Perfect (fast A/B variants) | ❌ Too slow/expensive |
| Seasonal campaign images | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Expensive to reshoot |
| Luxury/high-end branding | ⚠️ Supplementary use | ✅ Essential |

**Best practice:** Use real photography for your main product listing image, and AI for lifestyle shots, seasonal content, social media, and ad creative testing.

## Step-by-Step: Generate Product Photos with Nano Banana

### Step 1: Prepare Your Product Image

For best results, start with a clear photo of your actual product. It doesn't need to be professional — even a phone photo works:

- Shoot against a plain background (white wall, blank paper)
- Make sure the product is well-lit (near a window works)
- Capture the angle you want in the final image

### Step 2: Upload and Describe

Go to [Nano Banana Studio](https://nanobananastudio.com/app) and:

1. Upload your product photo
2. Describe the scene you want

### Step 3: Use the Right Prompt

The prompt is where the magic happens. Here are templates for the most common e-commerce scenarios:

---

## Prompt Templates (Copy & Customize)

### White Background Product Shot

```
Product photography of [your product] on a pure white background,
studio lighting, sharp focus, commercial product photo,
high resolution, clean and minimal
```

**Example:**
```
Product photography of a matte black ceramic coffee mug on a pure
white background, studio lighting, sharp focus, commercial product
photo, high resolution, clean and minimal
```

### Lifestyle Scene

```
[Your product] in a [setting], [mood/lighting], lifestyle product
photography, natural and inviting, commercial quality
```

**Example:**
```
A ceramic coffee mug on a rustic wooden kitchen table, morning
sunlight streaming through the window, steam rising from the cup,
lifestyle product photography, warm and cozy atmosphere,
commercial quality
```

### Flat Lay / Top-Down

```
Top-down flat lay of [your product] with [complementary items],
on [surface], organized and aesthetic, product photography,
soft even lighting
```

**Example:**
```
Top-down flat lay of a skincare set with dried flowers,
cotton pads, and a small green plant, on a marble surface,
organized and aesthetic, product photography, soft even lighting
```

### Seasonal Campaign

```
[Your product] in a [seasonal setting], [seasonal elements],
festive product photography, [mood], commercial advertising quality
```

**Example (Holiday):**
```
A scented candle surrounded by pine branches, red berries, and
gold ornaments, soft bokeh lights in background, festive holiday
product photography, warm and magical, commercial advertising quality
```

**Example (Summer):**
```
A water bottle on a sandy beach with ocean waves in background,
bright sunny day, tropical vibes, summer product photography,
fresh and energetic, commercial advertising quality
```

### Scale / Size Reference

```
[Your product] next to [everyday object for scale], on [surface],
product photography showing actual size, clean composition,
studio lighting
```

**Example:**
```
A compact wireless earbuds case next to a coin for scale,
on a clean white desk, product photography showing actual size,
clean composition, studio lighting
```

### Model / In-Use Shot

```
A person [using/wearing/holding] [your product] in [setting],
[demographic details if relevant], natural pose, lifestyle
photography, commercial quality, [mood]
```

**Example:**
```
A young woman wearing wireless headphones while working at a
modern desk, natural pose, lifestyle photography, commercial
quality, productive and focused atmosphere
```

## Pro Tips for Better AI Product Photos

### 1. Be Specific About Materials

Instead of "a bag," say "a genuine leather crossbody bag with brass hardware and adjustable strap." Material details help AI generate realistic textures.

### 2. Specify the Lighting

Different lighting creates different moods:

| Lighting Type | Best For | Prompt Keywords |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Studio lighting | Clean product shots | "studio lighting, soft box" |
| Natural light | Lifestyle scenes | "natural sunlight, golden hour" |
| Dramatic | Premium/luxury | "dramatic side lighting, deep shadows" |
| Soft/diffused | Beauty/skincare | "soft diffused lighting, even illumination" |

### 3. Include Negative Details

Tell the AI what you don't want:

```
...no text, no watermarks, no logos, no distracting background elements
```

### 4. Reference a Style

```
...in the style of Apple product photography
...in the style of Glossier beauty ads
...in the style of IKEA catalog photography
```

### 5. Use Image-to-Image for Consistency

Upload an existing product photo and describe the new scene. This keeps your actual product recognizable while changing the context.

With **Nano Banana Pro**, you can upload up to 14 reference images — perfect for maintaining brand consistency across multiple product shots.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Dropshipping & Print-on-Demand

You have a manufacturer's basic product photo but need lifestyle images for your store. AI can place your product in professional settings without ordering samples.

### Etsy & Handmade Sellers

You make products at home but don't have a photography setup. AI can generate the supplementary lifestyle shots that make listings stand out.

### Amazon A+ Content

Your main image should be a real photo, but A+ content benefits from lifestyle and comparison images. AI can generate these at scale.

### Social Media & Ads

Need 20 variations of a product shot for Instagram ads? AI generates them in minutes instead of days.

### Pre-Launch Marketing

Product isn't manufactured yet? Generate realistic mockups from concept sketches or CAD renders.

## Cost Comparison

| Method | Cost | Time | Result |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Professional studio | $300–1000/session | 1–2 weeks | 10–20 images |
| DIY photography | $50–200 (equipment) | Hours per product | Varies in quality |
| Stock photo compositing | $10–50/image | 30–60 min per image | Generic look |
| **AI generation (Nano Banana)** | **$0.10–0.20/image** | **1–2 min per image** | **Professional quality** |

With Nano Banana's Starter plan ($4.95 first month), you get 50 generations — enough for a complete product catalog launch.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Vague Prompts

**Bad:** "product photo of a shoe"

**Good:** "Product photography of a white Nike-style running shoe on a pure white background, studio lighting with subtle reflection on glossy surface, sharp focus, high-end commercial quality"

### 2. Ignoring Platform Requirements

- **Amazon:** Main image must be on pure white background (RGB 255,255,255)
- **Shopify:** Consistent aspect ratios across all product images
- **Instagram:** Square or 4:5 aspect ratio performs best

### 3. Over-Processing

Don't stack too many style modifiers. Keep it focused:

**Too much:** "HDR, ultra-detailed, 8K, hyperrealistic, cinematic, dramatic, vibrant, professional..."

**Just right:** "Product photography, studio lighting, sharp focus, commercial quality"

### 4. Using AI for Main Listing Images

For marketplaces like Amazon, use real product photos as your main image. AI is best for supplementary images, lifestyle shots, and marketing content.
