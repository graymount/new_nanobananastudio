AI image generation is revolutionizing how we create visual content. Instead of spending hours in Photoshop or hiring a designer, you can now describe what you want in plain English and get a stunning image in seconds.

## How AI Image Generation Works

Modern AI image generators use deep learning models trained on millions of images and their descriptions. When you type a prompt like "a cyberpunk city at sunset with neon lights," the AI:

1. **Understands your text** - Natural language processing breaks down your description into concepts
2. **Maps concepts to visuals** - The model associates words with visual features it learned during training
3. **Generates the image** - Through a process called diffusion, the AI creates an image that matches your description

## Text-to-Image vs Image Editing

There are two main ways to use AI for images:

### Text-to-Image Generation
Start from scratch. Describe what you want, and the AI creates it from nothing. Perfect for:
- Creating original artwork
- Generating illustrations for content
- Visualizing ideas and concepts

### AI Image Editing
Transform existing images with natural language. Upload a photo and describe the changes you want. Great for:
- Changing the style of photos
- Adding or removing elements
- Enhancing image quality
