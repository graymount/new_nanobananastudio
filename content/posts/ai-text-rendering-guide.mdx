One of the biggest challenges in AI image generation has been accurate text rendering. Misspellings, garbled letters, and unreadable fonts plagued early AI models. But with Nano Banana Pro, professional-quality text rendering is finally here.

## The Text Rendering Revolution

Nano Banana Pro features "advanced text rendering for legible, stylized typography." This means you can now generate:

- Logos with crisp, correctly spelled text
- Posters with readable headlines
- Infographics with accurate data labels
- Product mockups with real brand names
- Social media graphics with clear messaging

## The Key Principle: Be Explicit

The secret to accurate text rendering is **explicit specification**. Don't just say "add text"—describe exactly what you want:

**Instead of:**
> A poster with some text

**Write:**
> A vintage concert poster with the text "JAZZ NIGHT" in bold red serif font at the top center. Below in smaller white sans-serif text: "Friday, March 15th at 8PM"

## The Text Prompt Formula

Use this formula for consistent results:

```
[Design description] with the text "[EXACT TEXT]" in [font style]
[color] [size] at [position].
```

### Font Style Descriptors
- **Serif:** Traditional, elegant (Times, Georgia)
- **Sans-serif:** Modern, clean (Helvetica, Arial)
- **Script:** Handwritten, flowing
- **Display/Decorative:** Bold, attention-grabbing
- **Monospace:** Technical, code-like
- **Handwritten:** Casual, personal

### Size Descriptors
- Large/prominent/headline
- Medium/body text
- Small/subtitle/caption

### Position Descriptors
- Top center, bottom left, middle right
- Overlaid on the image
- In a banner/ribbon/badge
- Along the bottom edge

## Practical Examples

### Logo Design

**Prompt:**
> Minimalist tech company logo. The text "NEXUS" in bold geometric sans-serif font, silver gray color. Clean white background. The letter X has a subtle gradient from blue to purple.

### Movie Poster

**Prompt:**
> Cinematic movie poster, dark moody atmosphere. Title "THE LAST HORIZON" in large distressed metallic font at the top. Tagline "Some journeys have no return" in small italic white text at the bottom center.

### Product Packaging

**Prompt:**
> Premium coffee bag design. Brand name "MOUNTAIN ROAST" in rustic brown serif font arched at the top. "Single Origin • Ethiopia" in small caps below. Kraft paper texture background.

### Social Media Graphic

**Prompt:**
> Instagram quote graphic with soft gradient background (pink to purple). The text "Create Something Beautiful Today" in elegant white script font, centered. Small attribution "@nanobananastudio" in the bottom right corner.

### Infographic Header

**Prompt:**
> Professional infographic header section. Title "2024 AI TRENDS" in bold navy blue sans-serif. Subtitle "Key insights from industry leaders" in lighter gray below. Clean white background with subtle geometric accents.

## Best Practices

### 1. Generate Text First, Then Image
For complex text, generate the text content first, then request the illustrated version:

> "First, write a catchy headline for a summer sale poster. Then create the poster with that headline."

### 2. Use Quotation Marks
Always put the exact text in quotation marks to clearly indicate what should appear in the image:

> The poster displays "SUMMER SALE - 50% OFF" prominently...

### 3. Specify Character Count
For limited space, mention the text length:

> A button with short text "GO" in bold white letters...

### 4. Describe Typography Context
Give context about where the text appears:

> A vintage typewriter with a paper showing the typed text "Chapter One"...

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Vague Text Requests
❌ "Add a title to the image"
✅ "Add the title 'ADVENTURE AWAITS' in bold white sans-serif at the top"

### 2. Forgetting Quotation Marks
❌ Add the word hello to the sign
✅ Add the text "HELLO" to the sign

### 3. Ignoring Position
❌ "A poster with the text 'SALE'"
✅ "A poster with 'SALE' in large red letters centered in the upper third"

### 4. Complex Multi-line Text
❌ Trying to render a full paragraph
✅ Keep text short—headlines, titles, single phrases work best
